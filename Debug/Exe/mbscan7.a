;date: 06-11-2019
;derived from mbscan6.c
;todo:
;*add 4~20ma linearisation
;*add voltage linearisation
;add offset
;add skip status to relay and led logic
;skip channel 8 if thermocouple selected on any channel and collect ch8 data for ambient calculation
;ambient calibration temp value in rhi-8
;add ambient compensation to thermocouples
;
;
;
;derived from mbscan4.c
;to do:
;*add led logic
;*add decimal point for pt100 0.1
;*add relay logic and link to led status
;*add common relay logic
;*add range limits for thermocouple and pt100
;*add skip status
;*eeprom store and retrieve dp status.
;*add serial speed
;
;
;derived from mbscan3.c
;date: 01-11-2019
;reason:
;to add voltage and 4~20mA tables
;to correct blinking issue
;to add decimal point
;
;date 04-10-2019
;reason: to add menu routines
;main menu: Scan time st,offset OSx8, skip/unskip x 8,alarm low x 8,alarm high x8,input x 8, modbus id,baudrate
;
;
;derived from mbscan1.c
;date: 2-10-2019
;achieved:
;*display and led scan
;*adc 3421 operating with mux scanning
;
;
;todo
;* scan display with chno. on bottom and pv on top. fixed scan time of 2 seconds
